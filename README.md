This project is purely built using Python only.
I have used python inbuilt libraries to build this project.
For Storing the data i have userd Files to store it in CSV format.
There are 4 files : 
1.Products : which has the productId,name,price,quantity
2.Sales : saleId,empId,customerId,totalbill,dateTime
3.customers : customerId,name,contact
4.employees : employeeId,name,contact

The system has a Home UI with two buttons open billing and exit button
when you click on open billing, a new pop up box will be opened and will be asked to enter the employeeId.
If the Id exists it will redirect to the billing page where you can generate bills
You need to enter customer name, phone number, product and quantity and click on add to bill
when you click on calclulate total it will tell the final amount to be paid.
when we click on generate bill, a proper pdf will be generatead which will have all the details of the bill.
